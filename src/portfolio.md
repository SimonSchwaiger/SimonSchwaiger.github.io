<h3><a href="https://github.com/SimonSchwaiger/tinysim-2d" target=”_blank”>Tinysim</a></h3>

A lightweight time-discrete mobile robot simulator for ROS 2. It can reconstruct simulation scenes from recorded sensor data (3D or 2D maps) and simulate various laser scanners and depth sensors using Open3D as the underlying engine.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SimonSchwaiger/ros-ml-container" target=”_blank”>ROS Machine Learning Container</a></h3>

Docker-based ROS development environment combining scientific computing frameworks such as PyTorch and Scikit-Learn with ROS (2), making the workspace somewhat portable. Additionally, graphics acceleration methods can be set based on your GPU's vendor. It bridges the gap between modern Python and web tools and robotics applications.

This workspace was originally created for my master thesis, but is now used by students and lecturers at UAS Technikum Wien's robotics group and serves as the basis of my homelab's machine learning instances. Common configurations are pre-build using GitHub workflows and hosted in the GitHub Container Registry.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SimonSchwaiger/SimonSchwaiger.github.io" target=”_blank”>Academic Website Template</a></h3>

Academic website template written in CSS and HTML accompanied by a simple Python-based build script. The website is built and styled from content written in Markdown. The site is built using GitHub workflows and deployed using GitHub pages.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SimonSchwaiger/home-lab" target=”_blank”>Homelab</a></h3>

Automatically deployed, self-hosted services including machine learning instances and cloud storage using Docker, Ansible and Nextcloud. The machine learning instances are based on my ROS Machine Learning Container.

## Professional Work

### UGV-CBRN Robot

A search and rescue robot for exploring disaster vicinities, radiation mapping and sampling of potentially hazardous substances. The robot was developed as part of the FFG-funded research project UGV-ABC Probe with my research focus being the implementation of Lidar-based autonomous navigation as well as 3D vision and an assisted teleoperation system.

### ODIN Robot

**O**bjective-**D**riven **I**ntelligent **N**avigator is an autonomous outdoor robot for logustics duties around the UAS Technikum campus and in agricultural use cases. My main role on this robot was the conversion of the original teleoperated chassis to full Lidar-based autonomy, including reverse-engingeering the electronics, changing the main control board and converting the controller to use the robot operating system (ROS).

<h3><a href="https://github.com/TW-Robotics/AIAV" target=”_blank”>AI Anwenden und Verstehen Website and Blogposts (in German)</a></h3>

Research project that aims to explain both fundamental as well as state of the art concepts from the domain of artifical intelligence to small and medium-sized businesses. Apart from presenting fundamental theory surrounding AI, <a href="https://www.aiav.technikum-wien.at/" target=”_blank”>our website</a> also presents blog posts about practical AI use cases as well as a list of institutions in Austria working on AI. I was heavily involved in blogpost creation, website administration and coordination.
