# About Me

Hi there! I’m Simon Schwaiger, a robotics enthusiast with a deep passion for autonomous mobile robots, hardware-accelerated programming and intelligent control. My journey in engineering has been fueled by curiosity and a drive to solve complex problems through innovation.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in **Mechatronics/Robotics** and a Master's degree in **Embedded Systems** at [University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/), where I've been working as a Lecturer and Researcher since March 2020. Since doing an internship at the [Telekom Innovation Laboratories in Berlin](https://laboratories.telekom.com/), my interest in engineering has revolved around modern control approaches in robotics. Currently, I am enrolled as a doctoral student in **Computer Science** at the Graz University of Technology, working on traversability evaluation and control strategies for outdoor mobile robots.

## What I Do

Over the years, I've worked on multiple projects involving robots in the real world. My work has focused on developing algorithms for mobile robots, optimizing control strategies, and designing hardware and software architectures.

Currently, I am focused on designing and implementing intelligent robotic systems that aim to make a real difference in people’s lives. 

My current work spans:

- **Data-Driven Robotics**: Developing autonomous systems capable of learning and acting in the real world.

- **Foundation Model Distillation**: Using pretrained foundation models to make robots understand the world and act more intelligently in their environments.

- **Cloud/Web Technologies in Robotics:** Leveraging web technologies such as Docker, Ansible, and Compose to improve usability and maintainability of robotic systems.

- **Learning-Based Control**: Developing algorithms for mobile robots to learn and adapt to their environments.

I try to work in established open-source frameworks and make my work publically available on GitHub. I also like to share my knowledge with others through publications.

## Outside the Lab

When I’m not immersed in coding or building robotic systems, you’ll probably find me working in the garden, woodworking or hiking.

I believe that staying curious and engaged in the world around me fuels my creativity in tech.
