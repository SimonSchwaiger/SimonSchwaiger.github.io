## Master Robotics Engineering

---

### Deployment of Autonomous Robot Systems (VO + Lab)

**Course developer, coordinator and lecturer** *Winter Term 2023 - Now*

Fundamental approaches to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) based on probabilistic reasoning are discussed in-depth (filter-based and graph SLAM). Presented methods serve as a reference for subsequent discussion of state of the art mapping approaches, such as semantic SLAM and Neural Radiance Fields. The lecture is acommpanied by a lab, where students implement their own 3D mapping system on a disaster response robot. Conducted in the third semester of the Master Robotics Engineering study program.

### Modern Methods for Sensor-Based Robot Control (Lab)

**Development of lab exercises and lecturer** *Summer Term 2023 - Summer Term 2024*

Project-focussed lab accompanying the theory lecture on computer vision. Presentation of fundamental concepts in robot vision (camera models, convolution, edge detection) with an outlook to machine learning (principal component analysis, classic classification and regression techniques) as well as deep learning (neural networks, convolutional neural networks). Conducted in the second semester of the Master Robotics Engineering study program.

## Campus International Program

---

### Service and Object-Oriented Algorithms in Robotics (ILV)

**Course developer, coordinator and lecturer** *Winter Term 2022 - Now*

Introductory course to data-driven algorithms commonly deployed in autonomous mobile robots. The lecture consists of a bootcamp-style theory lecture and a semester project where students solve the kidnapped robot problem in a maze. Conducted in UAS Technikum's **Campus International** program.

### Mobile Robotics (ILV)

**Course developer, coordinator and lecturer** *Winter Term 2024 - Now*

Introductory course on mobile robots with a focus on control. Students are introduced to robot kinematics and basic modelling of physical behaviour and solve a semester project, where they implement a local planner based on model predictive control. Conducted in UAS Technikum's **Campus International** program.

### Scientific Writing and Research Methods (ILV)

**Reviewer of scientific work conducted by students** *Winter Term 2022 - Now*

Introductory course on writing scientific publications. Conducted in the fith semester of the **Bachelor Mechatronics/Robotics** study program.

---

### Mobile and Service Robotics (UE)

**Lecturer for practicals** *Summer Term 2022, Winter Term 2024*

Introduction to autonomous mobile robot control including kinematics, global planning and local trajectory control. Conducted in the fith semester of the **Bachelor Mechatronics/Robotics** study program.
